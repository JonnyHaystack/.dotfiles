# My dotfiles
This repo contains my Linux configuration files (or "dotfiles").
# Setting up on new machine
1. Add the new machine's SSH key to my GitHub account
2. Clone this repo
3. Once cloned, I can run the script "install.sh". This will create symlinks so
that all my config files appear in their correct locations.
4. For fonts to work, run `fc-cache -fv`
